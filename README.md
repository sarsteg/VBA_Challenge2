# VBA-challenge

Hello! Welcome to my VBA Challenge documentation. Thanks for checking out my project.

This project is a part of the Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp at the University of Texas at San Antonio and focuses on developing VBA code in Microsoft Excel that can successfully be run on multiple sheets within a workbook. This project was developed using Microsoft Excel 365.

The purpose of the project is to create summaries of stocks across three years, 2018, 2019, and 2020. The summary table includes the yearly change, percentage change, and total stock volume for each stock (called tickers on the file). Once the summary table was created, the greatest percentage change, lowest percentage change and highest total stock volume were identified. Some methods used in the project include For loops and conditional formatting.

This responsitory includes the following:

* **"Module1.bas":** The VBA code for the project
* **"Multiple_year_stock_data":** Excel template; use this document to run Module1.bas
* **"Screenshots of Results" folder:** contains screenshots of every tab on the file "Multiple_year_stock - Completed"; the completed version of the file is too large for uploading to GitHub, but may be accessed here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yXcfQiYD-ncT_8HzupskLQ6RzXSx7kmq/view?usp=sharing

* **"Module 2 Challenge Instructions.pdf"**: Instructions for the project. I have added notes and highlights to the document to help with my comprehension and to track of my progress.
* **"Solution Images"** folder: contains screenshots of the instructor's solution for the project
* **"Testing" folder:** contains old versions of the documents for the project
* **"How to" folder:** contains resources used in the creation of the code.
* **"README.md"**: That's this file! It's a overview of the repository

**Note:** Due to the size of the data and the VBA code, running the code on the template will take some time. To help speed this up, I've turned off the screen update for the code (Don't worry, it is turned back on at the end of the code). If you would prefer to see the screen updates as Excel runs the code, you may comment out this section in the VBA by adding an apostrophy (') before the respective code.
